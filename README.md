# Post-Strom-Imagery
This project is focused on establishing a scalable and automated system for real-time flood detection and mapping, merging NASA DRCS and Copernicus satellite data to create GIS-compatible outputs for policymakers, responders, and impacted populations.


# Flood Response and Mapping Pipeline

## Overview
This project focuses on creating an automated pipeline for real-time flood detection and mapping, leveraging satellite imagery and machine learning to assist disaster response teams. By integrating data from NASAâ€™s Disaster Response Coordination System (DRCS) and the Copernicus satellite program, the solution generates GIS-compatible flood extent maps to support emergency managers, policymakers, insurance companies, and affected communities.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Flood Mapping**: Automated analysis of satellite imagery for near-instant flood detection.
- **GIS-Compatible Outputs**: Generation of flood extent shapefiles for visualization and decision-making.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Advanced algorithms for improved accuracy in flood predictions.
- **Scalable and User-Friendly**: A robust system designed for disaster response teams and stakeholders at all levels.

## Data Sources
1. **NASA DRCS**: Real-time satellite imagery for disaster response.
2. **Copernicus Program**: European satellite data for environmental monitoring.
3. **Historical Flood Data**: For training and validating prediction models.

## Objectives
- Enable disaster response teams to allocate resources effectively during floods.
- Provide actionable insights for long-term planning (e.g., insurance and property risk assessments).
- Foster collaboration across organizations and communities.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Geopandas
- **Tools**: QGIS, Trimble Geo locators
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS
